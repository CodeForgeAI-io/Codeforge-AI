    body: `# What is CodeForge AI?

CodeForge AI is an AI-powered coding-interview preparation platform. It combines a
deep problem bank, an instant multi-language compiler, AI mentoring, spaced
repetition, skill analytics, contests, and a community — so you can practice
smarter and walk into interviews with confidence.

## What you can do

- **Solve DSA problems** in a VS Code-style editor across 12 languages.
- **Run code instantly** in the standalone [Compiler](/compiler) with custom input.
- **Get unstuck** with the AI Mentor — hints, debugging help and complexity analysis.
- **Retain what you learn** with SM-2 spaced repetition (Smart Revision).
- **Track your growth** with skill analytics and weakness detection.
- **Compete** in weekly contests and climb the leaderboard.
- **Prepare for companies** with curated question sets.

## Plans

The core platform is free. Paid **Go** and **Plus** plans unlock more AI credits
and advanced features — see [Plans & pricing](/help/plans-and-pricing).

CodeForge AI ships a REST API under \`/api\`. An interactive **OpenAPI/Swagger**
explorer is available at \`/docs\` (admin access).

## Authentication

Protected endpoints use your **session cookie**, set after you sign in via
NextAuth. Call the API from the same origin (the browser sends the cookie
automatically), for example from your own dashboard scripts or the in-app client.

\`\`\`js
// Same-origin fetch — the session cookie is sent automatically
const res = await fetch("/api/billing/usage");
const data = await res.json();
console.log(data.usage); // { used, allowance, remaining, ... }
\`\`\`

Public endpoints (problem listing, search, discussions read) don't require a
session. Mutating requests must be **same-origin** (a CORS guard blocks
cross-site writes) and bodies are capped at 1 MB.`,

A few of the most useful endpoints (see \`/docs\` for the full reference):

### List problems
\`\`\`http
GET /api/questions?difficulty=Easy&category=Arrays&page=1
\`\`\`

### Run code against sample cases
\`\`\`http
POST /api/execute
{ "questionId": "...", "language": "python", "code": "..." }
\`\`\`

### Run code in the standalone compiler
\`\`\`http
POST /api/compiler
{ "language": "javascript", "code": "console.log(1+1)", "stdin": "" }
\`\`\`

### Ask the AI Mentor (streaming)
\`\`\`http
POST /api/ai/chat
{ "questionId": "...", "message": "Give me a hint" }
\`\`\`
The response is a streamed text body — read it incrementally.

### Your AI usage
\`\`\`http
GET /api/billing/usage
\`\`\`

All examples assume an authenticated, same-origin request.`,

Recurring subscriptions are driven by Razorpay webhooks at
\`POST /api/subscription/webhook\`.

- The endpoint verifies the \`x-razorpay-signature\` against your
  \`RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET\` using a constant-time comparison.
- Deliveries are **idempotent** — a duplicate event id is ignored.
- Handled events: \`subscription.charged\` (renew + record an invoice),
  \`subscription.activated\`, \`subscription.cancelled\`, \`subscription.halted\`,
  \`subscription.completed\`, and \`payment.failed\`.

**Is CodeForge AI free?**
Yes — the core platform is free, including 90 AI credits per month. Paid plans add
more credits and advanced features.

**Which languages are supported?**
12: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C, C++, C#, Go, PHP, Rust, Kotlin, Swift.

**Do I need a credit card to start?**
No. You can use the free plan and the 7-day trial on paid plans without a card.

**Why won't the AI Mentor answer my non-coding question?**
By design — the mentor is scoped to coding, DSA and interview-prep topics.

**What happens when I run out of AI credits?**
You'll see a message and an upgrade option. Credits reset monthly.

**How do I get an invoice?**
Settings → Billing & Usage → Subscription history → **Invoice**.

**Can I cancel anytime?**
Yes. Cancelling stops auto-renewal; you keep access until the period ends.
