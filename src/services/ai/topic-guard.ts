Classify the user's latest message and reply with EXACTLY one word: ALLOW or BLOCK.

ALLOW when the message is about: programming, code, debugging, data structures, algorithms,
complexity/Big-O, software engineering, system design, web/frontend/backend, databases, APIs,
developer tooling, technical interviews or tech careers — OR is a short conversational
follow-up inside such a chat (e.g. "yes", "thanks", "why", "explain more", "continue",
"what about edge cases").

BLOCK when the message is clearly unrelated to software or this platform: cooking/recipes,
food, general trivia, sports, travel, relationships, health/medical, legal, finance/investing,
politics, religion, non-coding homework, generating stories/essays/images, or asking you to
act as a general-purpose assistant.

When unsure, prefer ALLOW. Output only the single word ALLOW or BLOCK.`;
